# Developer Notes: Platform-Agnostic Multi-Agent System

## Current State

### Agent Architecture
- Base agent class with abstract methods for system prompts
- Specialized agents (CFO, CTO) with role-specific implementations
- Simple regex-based agent selection
- Slack-specific message routing and handling

### Conversation Management
- Basic conversation history tracking per channel/user
- 10-message history limit
- History management coupled with router implementation

## Planned Changes

### 1. Platform Agnosticism
- Extract core routing logic into base MessageRouter class
- Implement platform-specific adapters (Slack, etc.)
- Move channel-specific formatting to adapter layer
- Standardize message event structure across platforms

### 2. Agent Selection Enhancement
- Replace regex-based selection with NLP/intent analysis
- Implement intelligent agent planning and coordination
- Support dynamic agent loading and configuration
- Enable multi-agent collaboration for complex queries

### 3. Conversation Management
- Move history management to individual agents
- Implement more sophisticated context tracking
- Add support for long-term memory and knowledge retention
- Enable cross-agent conversation context sharing

### 4. Architecture Improvements
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Enhance error handling and recovery
- Implement rate limiting and throttling

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1: Core Refactoring**
   - Create MessageRouter base class
   - Extract platform-specific code to adapters
   - Implement standardized message interfaces

2. **Phase 2: Agent Enhancement**
   - Develop NLP-based agent selection
   - Implement agent coordination system
   - Enhance conversation management

3. **Phase 3: Platform Expansion**
   - Add support for additional platforms
   - Implement cross-platform features
   - Enhance security and monitoring

## Technical Considerations

### Message Flow
```
User Input → Platform Adapter → Message Router → Agent Planner → Selected Agent(s) → Response Formatter → Platform Adapter → User
```

### Key Interfaces
- IMessageRouter: Core routing interface
- IPlatformAdapter: Platform-specific adapters
- IAgent: Enhanced agent interface
- IConversationManager: Conversation state management

### Configuration
- Externalize agent configurations
- Support dynamic agent loading
- Environment-specific settings
- Platform-specific configurations

## Migration Strategy

1. **Preparation**
   - Add comprehensive tests for existing functionality
   - Document current behavior and edge cases
   - Create staging environment for testing

2. **Implementation**
   - Implement changes incrementally
   - Maintain backward compatibility
   - Add feature flags for gradual rollout

3. **Validation**
   - Extensive testing of new components
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Security review

4. **Deployment**
   - Staged rollout strategy
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - Rollback procedures

## Future Considerations

- Scalability improvements
- Advanced agent capabilities
- Machine learning enhancements
- Additional platform integrations
- Enhanced analytics and insights
